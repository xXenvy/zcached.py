class Connection:
    """
    An object to establish and manage a connection with the database server.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host:
        The host address of the server to connect to.
    port:
        The port number of the server to connect to.
    buff_size:
        The size of the buffer for receiving data from the server, in bytes.
        Larger values for buff_size may allow for more data to be received in a single operation,
        while smaller values can be more memory-efficient but slower.
    connection_attempts:
        The maximum number of attempts to establish a connection with the server.
        If the maximum number of attempts is exceeded, an error will be raised.
    reconnect:
        Flag indicating whether automatic reconnection attempt should be made
        in case of a broken connection.

    Attributes
    ----------
    socket: :class:`socket`
        The socket object for communicating with the server.
    buff_size: :class:`int`
        The size of the buffer for receiving data from the server.
    connection_attempts:
        The maximum number of attempts to establish a connection with the server.
    reconnect:
        Flag indicating whether automatic reconnection attempt should be made
        in case of a broken connection.
