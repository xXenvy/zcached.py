## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability in zcached.py, we encourage you to report it to us promptly. Your contribution helps us maintain the security and integrity of our project.

### How to Report
To report a vulnerability, simply create a new issue in our GitHub repository and provide detailed information about the issue.

### Vulnerability Resolution
If the vulnerability is verified and accepted, we will prioritize its resolution and provide updates on the steps taken to fix the issue. Once a fix is implemented, we will release a patched version of zcached.py as soon as possible.

In the event that the reported vulnerability is determined to be invalid or out of scope, we will inform you of our decision and provide an explanation for our assessment.

We appreciate your efforts in helping us maintain the security of zcached.py. Thank you for your responsible disclosure and collaboration.
