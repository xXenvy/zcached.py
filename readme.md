## `📜` Introduction
Zcached.py is a Python client-side library designed to interact with zcached, a high-performance caching system.
This library provides developers with an easy-to-use interface for integrating zcached into their Python applications, enabling efficient data caching.

For more information, please see [zcached repository](https://github.com/sectasy0/zcached).

## `🌟` Features
- **Simplified Caching:** Zcached.py simplifies the process of caching data by providing intuitive functions for storing and retrieving values.
- **Efficient Communication:** The library optimizes communication with the zcached server, ensuring minimal overhead and efficient data transfer.
- **Properly Typehinted:** The codebase of zcached.py is properly typehinted, enhancing code readability.

## `🔧` Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Library requires python version 3.8 or newer.** (Older should also work, but untested).

Before installing zcached.py, ensure that you have the zcached server. Instructions for installing the server can be found [here](https://github.com/sectasy0/zcached).

Once the zcached server is installed, you can proceed to install zcached.py using pip:
```shell
pip install -U zcached.py
```

## `🖊️` Usage
Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use zcached.py in your Python code:
```py
from typing import List
from zcached import ZCached, Result

client = ZCached(host="localhost", port=5555)

if clinet.is_alive() is False:
  raise RuntimeError("Something went wrong.")

client.set(key="dogs", value=["Pimpek", "Laika"])

dogs_result: Result[List[str]] = client.get(key="dogs")
dbsize_result: Result[int] = client.dbsize()

client.save()
client.delete("dogs")
client.flush()
```
